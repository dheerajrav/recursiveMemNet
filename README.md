# recursiveMemNet

This is the code for the [Memory Augmented Recursive Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01545).

GRU Additions are in [here](https://github.com/dheerajrav/recursiveMemNet/blob/dheeraj_gru/equation_verification/nn_tree_model_new.py) (line 235-1086). 

To run the data, make sure to have atleast 7.5 * 3 GB of memory in your system, and run the shell script files. 

ODE generation code is [here](https://github.com/dheerajrav/recursiveMemNet/tree/dheeraj_gru/ODEgen/ODEgen)

Original paper's code is [here](https://github.com/ForoughA/recursiveMemNet)
