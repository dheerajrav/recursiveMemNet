# recursiveMemNet

This is the code for the [Memory Augmented Recursive Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01545).

GRU Additions are in the file *equation_verification/nn_tree_model_new.py* with class names TreeGRU\* (line 235-1086). 

To run the data, make sure to have atleast 7.5 * 3 GB of memory in your system, and run the shell script files.
